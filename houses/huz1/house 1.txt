What's special

Own a piece of NE Oklahoma history! The Harris House,built by Cheasquah Harris for whom Harris Rd and Harris Jobe school were named. His brother was Chief Colonel Johns Harris of the Cherokee Nation and his father, Redbird Harris, was a Muskogee Creek Nation official. They settled the land after the Trail of Tears and the original portion of the house (which was 2 rooms) date back to the Civil War when it was used as the hospital for Fort Davis. The home is on the Muskogee Historic Register.

Much of the home is in its original to early state, but most of it has been rewired in the last 10 years with the electric being buried and running from the street to the house. The house has been largely re-plumbed with PEX and a new gasline was put in from the street to the house. 

Sitting on a large lot with mature trees amongst some of Muskogee's loveliest homes, The Harris House needs some work, but is ready for a new chapter.
